Here is a brief map of the project with all the contents, listed  below. 

The CAPSTONE project. 

Current situation: 
  the customer,  Lending club does not have the comprehensive decsision-based predictive tool for classifying loan applications. The current processes are outdated and often the decisions are made, 
based on the case-by-case approach, manually.

Problem statement: 
 the board management states, that current practices are outdated  and time-consuming, the quality of loan portfolio can be improved, the risk-reward ratio - optimised, share of bad loand - decreased.

Hypothesis: 
 adopting thr alternative, ML-based predictive model will improve the accuracy of decisions made.

Key metrics: 
   -> model accuracy, AUC, recall
   -> the share of default loans
   -> profitability, net margin 

Project phases: 

 a) dataset basic preparation and cleaning: 
      - removing the duplicates, irrelevant columns
      - handling with missing values
      - working with data types 
      - normalizing data 
      - encoding categorical values
      - feature engineering 

 b) dataset analysis: 
      - exploring the structure, distribution, etc.. 
      - identifying the set of important features to deal with, their interrelationships
      - additional processing the missing values and outliers
      - summarising 

 c) modelling: 
      -  creating the baseline metrics setup 
      -  selecting the list of hypothesis models to apply, explaining why
      -  processing models, getting outputs
      -  summarising the results, choosing the best model
      -  conducting segmentation, applying the best performing model in combination with segmentation approach 
      -  the final summary
